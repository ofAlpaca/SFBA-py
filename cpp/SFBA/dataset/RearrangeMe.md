# Slice Rearrangement Steps:

1. Set up a timer to detect timeout.
2. When timer expire, a halting problem may happen.
3. To mitigate the cost of rearranging slices, do not re-random the slices.
4. Split everyone's slices into several pieces.
5. And re-run the SFBA to see if the halting problem solve.
